# Slinky Babylon Pioneer NFT Holder Checker

Welcome to the Wallet Eligibility Checker! This application allows you to quickly and easily check if your wallet address is eligible for specific benefits or giveaways.

## Features
- **Local Excel File Search**: For faster results, you can search from a pre-downloaded Excel file that contains all eligible wallet addresses.
- **Google Sheets Search**: Alternatively, you can perform a live search directly from an online Google Sheet to get the most up-to-date results.

## How to Use

### Step 1: Enter Your Wallet Address
- At the top of the page, you'll see an input field labeled "Enter your wallet address".
- Type or paste your wallet address into this field.

### Step 2: Choose Search Method
- **Search from Local Excel**: This option allows you to search from a pre-downloaded Excel file. It provides faster results, especially if you're checking many addresses.
- **Search from Google Sheets**: This option performs a live search using the latest data available in the Google Sheet. This ensures you have the most up-to-date information.

### Step 3: Click "Check Eligibility"
- Once you've entered your wallet address and selected your preferred search method, click the "Check Eligibility" button.
- The app will process your request and display one of the following messages:
  - **"You are eligible!"**: Your wallet address is found in the list.
  - **"Sorry, we didn't find your wallet address in the list."**: Your wallet address is not found in the list.

## Additional Information
- If you choose the **Local Excel** option and itâ€™s still loading, a message will appear saying "Loading local data, please wait...". The search button will be disabled until the data is ready.
- The application uses notifications to inform you of errors, such as issues with reading the local file or problems fetching data from Google Sheets.

## Troubleshooting
- **My address isn't found**: Double-check the wallet address you entered. Ensure there are no extra spaces or incorrect characters.
- **App is slow or unresponsive**: If you experience slowness, try refreshing the page or switching between search methods.
